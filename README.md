# Moving Square
## Description
This project was part of an assignment for a Computer Graphics and Object-Oriented Programming course I took during Spring 2024.

It renders a square that moves diagonally from the bottom left to the top right. Once the square is off-screen, it resets at the bottom left
and the process loops infinitely. The square also has a texture of Insomniac's Spider-Man logo mapped to it.

## Objective 
The goal was to learn how to move objects in OpenGL by manipulating the camera. Additionally, I learned about how shaders
work alongside the basics of texture mapping an image to a polygon.

## Stack
Lightweight Java Game Library (lwjgl) and OpenGL.
